# Interactive Atom Template 2021

**This is created using https://github.com/guardian/interactive-atom-template-2019 as a starting point.**

## What is it
This repo contains code for a new approach to building and deploying atoms at The Guardian. It uses Webpack 5 to build the atoms as opposed to the previous approach of using Gulp.
